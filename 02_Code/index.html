<h2>About</h2>

<p>Hello world!
<br>As the URL implies this site is built from scratch - by me.
<br>Me is an end-twenty-something year old business graduate from Hamburg, Germany who has been working as a an agile project manager in e-commerce since autumn 2013.
<br>You are looking at my personal skill-building project right now. My ambition is to build a personal website/blog all by myself. On the road I want to enhance my skills in every necessary direction - programming, conceptual design and graphic design.
<br>Please feel welcome to follow my progress!
<br>Keep in touch!
<br>
<br>Yours, Christine</p>

<h4>#5 WIP</h4>
<p>
Hello follower, 
<br>
I’m learning stuff about HTML5 and CSS3/SASS at the moment. When I feel „ready“ my next task will be to refactor everything ;-)  
<br>
I’ll keep you posted. 
<br>
Cheers!

<h4>#4 Fonts, styling and new sections</h4>
<p>
Hi reader, 
<br>
I'm really happy to present my temporary fonts. To me it is really amazing what an impact fonts actually have on a website. Since I did all the research and the decision on my own for the first time I can now look at those discussions on fonts from a different perspective. I believe that fitting fonts are taken for granted too often ;-) 
<br> 
Anyway - I can highly recommend browsing through Google Fonts in case you research some  yourself. It is a very accessible platform that makes it really easy to use the fonts on the web. Thumbs up!
<br> 
With this release I have opened two new sections to my website. You can find them in the header navigation: Product Backlog and Archive. 
<br>
The product backlog displays my current ideas on the further development of this website whereas the archive is used to monitor my progress. Before every new release I will post a screenshot of the former status. So - even if you take your first look after this 3rd release you can get an impression of the way so far :-)
<br>
Enjoy!
</p>

<h4>#3 Header and navigation</h4>
<p>
Hello again, 
<br>
despite being sick with a nasty cold I have been busy working myself through the classes on "frontend foundations". 
I'm really proud to present my temporary new design. I must say - I like petrol :-) 
<br>
I have also started watching a codeschool-class on design and therefore started researching color schemes and webfonts. Still I decided to follow continuous integration rather than having a full concept from the start. Also it's going to be more fun for you watching my amateur steps. 
<br>
As soon as I manage to post pictures I will supply you with an archive on the different versions of this website so you can monitor the progress. 
</p>

<h4>#2 From local to www</h4>
<p>Ok - so here I am with a recommended HTML-Editor called <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a> and a couple of folders on my mac.
<br>I am already pretty proud that I manage to watch my progress in my browser. However all of this is still local. I want to get it out to the www.
<br>I have heard stuff about "hosting" before. Also I know that one needs to buy/reserve certain URLs or domains in order to use them. But first things first - I need to name my project.
<br>"From scratch" it is. - Great! But where and how do I host this?
<br>Exkurs: Initially I thought about blogging about this on wordpress. But I don't want to work with ready-build templates and features.

<br>About 5 hours later - I'm LIVE! Wohooo!
<br>
<br>See you tmrw!</p>

<h4>#1 The idea</h4>
<p>"I want to learn programming!" I told my bf recently. He, being a professional software engineer, showed me the <a href="http://www.java-hamster-modell.de/" target="_blank">Java-Hamster</a> and by doing so he uncovered a spark that finally lead me here today.
<br>In the middle of having fun letting this hamster run through labyrinths and pick up seeds a dear friend from scandinavia skyped me. She told me about her newest business idea which required a website.
What a wonderful opportunity for me to finally learn this! At this point I turned my back on the cute Java-Hamster.
<br>Being hooked by the idea I found myself planning my own project. The one you look at right now. I want to learn all the stuff #fromscratch that I usually just organise as a project manager.
<br>I have plenty of ideas already - ranging from mere programming to tracking tools and visual elements I want to develop and style myself.
<br>To get started I have registered at <a href="http://www.codeschool.com" target="_blank">codeschool</a> and started with frontend foundations. The result of the first HTML/CSS class is basically what you see here right now. 
<p>This is also the mode I envision for the development of this website. It is possible that it will look different every day because I plan on updating stuff every time I learn something new.
<br>
<br>By the way - this post was written offline before I managed to bring my site online.
<br>
<br>Cheers!</p>
