				<h3>Version 1.1 (07/03/2016)</h3>
				<p>
				In this version I have updated some css. I managed to center all my content and built a very basic navigation in the header that also contains the section "archive" for the first time.  
				<br>
				Also I did some research on colors and color schemes and decided that my site should be petrol - at least for now.

				<h3>Version 1.0 (05/03/2016)</h3>
				<p>
				The picture below shows the first ever version of this site. Without colors, without fancy fonts - just plain white. 
				<br> 
				I have set this version up with plain html and little css. Very basic so to speak. On the road I have however gained many new experiences e.g. how to host a website, use filezilla and a proper html-editor.
