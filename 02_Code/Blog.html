<h4>#3 Header and navigation</h4>
<p>
Hello again, 
<br>
despite being sick with a nasty cold I have been busy working myself through the classes on "frontend foundations". 
I'm really proud to present my temporary new design. I must say - I like petrol :-) 
<br>
I have also started watching a codeschool-class on design and therefore started researching color schemes and webfonts. Still I decided to follow continuous integration rather than having a full concept from the start. Also it's going to be more fun for you watching my amateur steps. 
<br>
As soon as I manage to post pictures I will supply you with an archive on the different versions of this website so you can monitor the progress. 
</p>

<h4>#2 From local to www</h4>
<p>Ok - so here I am with a recommended HTML-Editor called <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a> and a couple of folders on my mac.</p>
<p>I am already pretty proud that I manage to watch my progress in my browser. However all of this is still local. I want to get it out to the www.</p>
<p>I have heard stuff about "hosting" before. Also I know that one needs to buy/reserve certain URLs or domains in order to use them. But first things first - I need to name my project.</p>
<p>"From scratch" it is. - Great! But where and how do I host this?</p>
<p>Exkurs:Initially I thought about blogging about this on wordpress. But I don't want to work with ready-build templates and features.</p>

<p>About 5 hours later - I'm LIVE! Wohooo!</p>

<p>See you tmrw!</p>

<h4>#1 The idea</h4>
<p>"I want to learn programming!" I told my bf recently. He, being a professional software engineer, showed me the <a href="http://www.java-hamster-modell.de/" target="_blank">Java-Hamster</a> and by doing so he uncovered a spark that finally lead me here today.</p> 
<p>In the middle of having fun letting this hamster run through labyrinths and pick up seeds a dear friend from scandinavia skyped me. She told me about her newest business idea which required a website.
What a wonderful opportunity for me to finally learn this! At this point I turned my back on the cute Java-Hamster.</p>
<p>Being hooked by the idea I found myself planning my own project. The one you look at right now. I want to learn all the stuff #fromscratch that I usually just organise as a project manager.</p>
<p>I have plenty of ideas already - ranging from mere programming to tracking tools and visual elements I want to develop and style myself.</p>
<p>To get started I have registered at <a href="http://www.codeschool.com" target="_blank">codeschool</a> and started with frontend foundations. The result of the first HTML/CSS class is basically what you see here right now. </p>
<p>This is also the mode I envision for the development of this website. It is possible that it will look different every day because I plan on updating stuff every time I learn something new.</p>

<p>By the way - this post was written offline before I managed to bring my site online.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
